# This is the Json contract required for the API. It includes dummy data,
Please note that the Keys must match exactly when communicating with the API (hence 'contract' ;) )

The Data does not necessarily have to be in this order, or even contain all of the data requested here.
The most important thing to note here is that each entry for AddressInfo, EmailInfo, and PhoneInfo simply contains a list of the relevant data.

BusinessInfo simply contains 
- UserId
- FirstName (new contact)
- LastName (new Contact)

AddressInfo contains
- AddressType
- StreetNumber
- StreetName
- City
- Country
- Province

EmailInfo contains
- EmailType
- Email Address

PhoneInfo contains
- PhoneType
- PhoneNumber

{
"BusinessInfo":
  ["1","Connor","Boutin"],
"AddressInfo":
  [
    ["School","4000","Central Florida","Orlando","USA","Florida"],
    ["Home Address","630","Main Street","Orlando","USA","Florida"]
  ],
"EmailInfo":
  [
    ["Personal","cjboutin@bellsouth.net"]
  ],
"PhoneInfo":
  [
    ["Cell","9542782404"]
  ]
}

# Adding a new user
Fairly straightforward. Send this in a post request to the AddUser URI described in the API URIs file.
{
"UserName":"NewUser",
"PasswordHash":"PHash"
}
